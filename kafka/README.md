# Monitoring Kafka with Prometheus and Grafana

A comprehensive Kafka monitoring plan should collect metrics from the following components:

* Kafka Broker(s)
* Kafka Cluster (which should include ZooKeeper metrics as Kafka relies on it to maintain its state)
* Producer(s) / Consumer(s) 

Kafka Broker, Zookeeper and Java clients (producer/consumer) expose metrics via JMX (Java Management Extensions) and can be configured to report stats back to Prometheus using the [JMX exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter) maintained by Prometheus.  There is also a number of exporters maintained by the community to explore. Some of them can be used in addition to the JMX export. To monitor Kafka, for example, the JMX exporter is often used to provide broker level metrics, while community exporters claim to provide more accurate cluster level metrics (e.g. [Kafka exporter](https://github.com/danielqsj/kafka_exporter), [Kafka Zookeeper Exporter by CloudFlare](https://github.com/cloudflare/kafka_zookeeper_exporter), and others). Alternatively, you can consider [writing your own custom exporter](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/writing_exporters/).

## What to monitor

A long list of metrics is made available by Kafka ([here](https://kafka.apache.org/documentation/#monitoring)) and Zookeeper ([here](https://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/current/zookeeperJMX.html)). The easiest way to see the available metrics is to fire up *jconsole* and point it at a running kafka client or Kafka/Prometheus server; this will allow browsing all metrics with JMX. But you are still left to figure out which ones you want to actively monitor and the ones that you want to be actively alerted. 

An simple way to get started would be to start with the [Grafanaâ€™s sample dashboards](https://grafana.com/dashboards) for the Prometheus exporters you chose to use and then modify them as you learn more about the available metrics and/or your environment on ICP. The [Monitoring Kafka metrics](https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/monitoring-kafka-performance-metrics/) article from *DataDog* provides great guidance to some of the key Kafka and Prometheus metrics and why you should care about them. In the next section, we will demonstrate exactly that; we will start with sample dashboards and make few modifications to exemplify how to configure key Kafka metrics to display in the dashboard.

### Configuring server and agents

For convenience and easy configuration, we will use Docker images from DockerHub and make few modifications to Dockerfiles to include few additional steps to install, configure and start the servers and exporter agents locally. 

#### <font color=blue>Kafka and Zookeeper servers with JMX Exporter</font>

We will start with the Dockerfile of the [Spotify kafka image](https://hub.docker.com/r/spotify/kafka/~/dockerfile/) from DockerHub as it includes Zookeeper and Kafka in a single image. The Dockerfile was modified as shown below to download, install the Prometheus JMX exporter. The exporter can be configured to scrape and expose mBeans of a JMX target. It runs as a Java Agent, exposing a HTTP server and serving metrics of the JVM. In the Dockerfile below, Kafka is started with JMX exporter agent on port 7071 and metrics will be expose in the /metrics endpoint. 

```
FROM java:openjdk-8-jre

ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND noninteractive
ENV SCALA_VERSION 2.11
ENV KAFKA_VERSION 0.10.2.2
ENV KAFKA_HOME /opt/kafka_"$SCALA_VERSION"-"$KAFKA_VERSION"

ENV KAFKA_OPTS "-javaagent:$KAFKA_HOME/jmx_prometheus_javaagent-0.9.jar=7071:$KAFKA_HOME/kafka-0-8-2.yml"

RUN wget -q https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/io/prometheus/jmx/jmx_prometheus_javaagent/0.9/jmx_prometheus_javaagent-0.9.jar -O "$KAFKA_HOME"/jmx_prometheus_javaagent-0.9.jar && \
    wget -q https://raw.githubusercontent.com/prometheus/jmx_exporter/master/example_configs/kafka-0-8-2.yml -O "$KAFKA_HOME"/kafka-0-8-2.yml

EXPOSE 7071
# end - modifications
# **********

CMD ["supervisord", "-n"]
```

For your convenience, the modified Dockerfile and scripts are available on this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/anagiordano/ibm-artifacts). You can run the following commands to create and run the container locally.

```shell
# download git repo with Dockerfile and scripts

mkdir /tmp/monitor
git clone https://github.com/anagiordano/ibm-artifacts.git /tmp/monitor/.

# build image 
docker build --tag kafka_i /tmp/monitor/kafka/.

# create container
docker run -d -p 2181:2181 -p 9092:9092 -p 7071:7071 --env ADVERTISED_PORT=9092 --name kafka_c kafka_i 

# create kafka topics
docker exec -it kafka_c /bin/bash
cd /opt/kafka*/bin
export KAFKA_OPTS=""
./kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-fact 1 --partitions 1 --topic my-topic1
./kafka-topics.sh --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-fact 1 --partitions 1 --topic my-topic2
./kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper localhost:2181

# (optional) produce few message into topic from console
./kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic my-topic1
./kafka-console-producer.sh --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic my-topic2

# exit container
exit
``` 
Lastly you can validate that the /metrics endpoint is returning metrics from Kafka. On a browser, open the http://localhost:7071/metrics URL.

#### <font color=blue>Prometheus Server and scrape jobs</font>

Prometheus uses a configuration file in YAML format to define the [scraping jobs and their instances](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/jobs_instances/). You can also use the configuration file to define [recording rules](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/recording_rules/) and [alerting rules](https://prometheus.io/docs/prometheus/latest/configuration/alerting_rules/):

* **Recording rules** allow you to precompute frequently needed or computationally expensive expressions and save their result as a new set of time series. Querying the precomputed result will then often be much faster than executing the original expression every time it is needed. This is especially useful for dashboards, which need to query the same expression repeatedly every time they refresh.

* **Alerting rules** allow you to define alert conditions based on Prometheus expression language expressions and to send notifications about firing alerts to an external service. Alerting rules in Prometheus servers send alerts to an Alertmanager. The [Alertmanager](https://prometheus.io/docs/alerting/alertmanager/) then manages those alerts, including silencing, inhibition, aggregation and sending out notifications via methods such as email, PagerDuty and others.

Below, we will go thru the steps to stand-up a local Prometheus server as a Docker container and to modify the configuration file to scrape Kafka metrics. 

1. Obtain the IP address of the Kafka container

```
docker run -d -p 9090:9090 prom/prometheus
```

2. Obtain the IP address of the Kafka container

```
docker inspect kafka_c | grep IPAddress
```

3. Edit the prometheus.yml to add Kafka as a target

```
docker exec -it prometheus_c \sh
vi /etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml
```

4. Locate the scrape_configs section in the properties file and add the lines below to define the Kafka job, 
where the IP should be the IP of the kafka container

``` 
  - job_name: 'kafka'                                                          
                                                                               
    static_configs:                                                            
    - targets: ['172.17.0.4:7071'] 

```
5. Reload the configuration file

```
ps -ef 
kill -HUP <prometheus PID>
```

6. You can now verify that Kafka is listed as a target job in Prometheus. On a Browser, open the http://localhost:9090/targets URL.
